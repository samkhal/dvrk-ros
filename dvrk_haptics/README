To run both sides of the da Vinci:

roscd dvrk_robot/config
rosrun dvrk_robot dvrk_full_ros -j two-arms.json

Then, to run the sine-wave haptic guidance:

roslaunch dvrk_haptics haptics.launch

-----------------------------------------------
Notes: 
1) The haptics node publishes a wrench to /dvrk_mtmr/set_wrench_static. Cisst must be configured to accept this, and to not override the wrench with gravity compensations.

2) The published force is currently applied in the frame of the da Vinci's virtual proxy tip. As a result, twisting the master tip (the final joint) away from it's default position will cause shifts in the force applied.
